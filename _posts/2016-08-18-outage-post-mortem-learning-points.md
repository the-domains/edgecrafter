  I like reading the outage Post Mortem some companies post, like Stack Overflow
  explaining how a simple Regex check caused an outage
  http://stackstatus.net/post/147710624694/outage-postmortem-july-20-2016As a
  tester the Post Mortem gives a good opportunity to learn what kind of
  operational issues which might be candidates for test scenarios. In general
  good practice about monitoring enough to be able to do efficient
  troubleshooting, infrastructure robustness, roll out procedures with built in
  verification steps, automated checkpoint for fallback and good SOP (standard
  operating procedures) are the major learning points. In one word, design for
  operational robustness is essential, an area I especially evaluate for systems
  with many components interacting. This Google post mortem a good example
